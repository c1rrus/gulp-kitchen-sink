## PR Guidelines

* Please keep your pull requests concise and limited to **one** substantive change at a time. This makes reviewing and testing so much easier.
* Please _always_ submit pull requests against the [dev branch](https://github.com/c1rrus/gulp-kitchen-sink/tree/dev).
* If you can, add some unit tests in the `spec/` directory.

## Coding style

* We use 2 space soft tabs for indentation, UNIX-style `\n` line endingsand UTF-8 encoding.
    * The repo contains an `.editorconfig` to automatically enforce this in [supported editors](http://editorconfig.org/#download).
* A definitive JavaScript style is still TBD. For now, please try to match the existing style in whatever file(s) you edit.
